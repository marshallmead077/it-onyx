<h1 class="bioh1">About Me! </h1>
<p class ="bio">
    My name is Marshall Mead and I love music! I play the drums, guitar, and bass and have being playing since forever. I get my love for music from my family because they either play music or teach it. Since I was little, I have been going with my dad and seeing him teach and perform. I saw plenty of performances and performers throughout my life and saw the making of the shows they put on. I also got to help put on music shows at Bryant, Arkansas city park, I helped with picking bands, getting vendors, and setting up the bands for 3 years. This was super fun and a great experience. I have also helped places hold open mics and played live my self. Since I love music and wanted to be more than just a guy that just plays in his room to the wall. I went to school for it and tried to get my a degree in it. Unfortunately, it was not what I was looking for. I liked the theory and rhythm classes, but they wanted me to learn jazz music, and I am not in to jazz that much to learn it, so I went to something different. My next choice was theater and working with sound, I fell in love with this kind of work and stuck with it until the end. But as time went on after I was done with my schooling, I was not having luck with jobs, so I needed something fast. I wanted to get in something that I was interested in but did not divert me too much away from recording music and making music on YouTube. So I went in to web development because I like computers and since YouTube is a site and other platforms I advertise on are as well, what better way to get to know the internet better than being able to make the sites that we use every day. This is where I am now, and I like it, but music still will be my passion and love, so videos will still be made, and I won't be leaving YouTube anytime soon. I love music too much to stop what I am doing, but anyway that is pretty much about me, so thanks for reading and geting to know me more!
